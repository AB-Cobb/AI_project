"Note: Sea ice is measured during the summer season. For the Northern Canadian Waters, the summer season is defined as the period from June 19 to November 19 for the Hudson Bay domain and from June 25 to October 15 for the Canadian Arctic domain. A statistically significant trend is reported when the Mann-Kendall test indicated the presence of a trend at the 95% confidence level.",
